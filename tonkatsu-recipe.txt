Ingredients:
	- 1/2  head of cabbage
	- 930 grams pork - loin chops (about 4 1" thick chops)
	-   salt
	- pepper
	- flour - all-purpose (for dusting
	- 1 large egg
	- 60 grams panko ~ 1 1/2 cups
	- oil for frying
	- 1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil

Directions:

for cabbage

1. To prepare the cabbage salad, separate the leaves from the head, trim off the tough stems, roll a few leaves together and use a sharp knife to slice the cabbage into thin threads. If you have a mandoline, you can leave the half-head of cabbage whole and just mandoline the cabbage and then pick out the tough bits.
2. Soak the cabbage in cold water while you prepare the rest of the ingredients. This not only crisps the cabbage it tames some of the cabbagy funk.

for tonkatsu
1. Prepare two bowls, one with a well beaten egg and the other with the panko. Prepare a wire rack lined with 2 paper towels.

2. Add 1 1/2-inches of oil to a heavy bottomed pot and then add 1 tablespoon of toasted sesame oil. Heat the oil to 340 degrees F (170 C).

3. For the pork, salt and pepper both sides. You can also add other seasonings here.

4. Dust the chops with an even coating of flour.

5. Dip the cutlet in the egg and coat evenly.

6. Transfer the pork to the panko and dust evenly, pressing down gently on the cutlet to ensure you get a good coating of breadcrumbs.

7. Fry the cutlets until the panko is golden brown and they register 145 degrees F (63 C) with an instant read thermometer. Flip once to ensure even browning and use a skimmer to remove any foam that accumulates on the surface of the oil. Be sure to remove the katsu from oil before measuring the temperature or you'll end up getting a false reading. Depending on how thick your chops are they will take anywhere from 7-10 minutes to cook through.

8. Drain the pork on the paper towel lined rack and let it rest for a few minutes.

9.While the pork rests, drain the cabbage and use a salad spinner to remove any excess moisture. Place big mounds of cabbage on each plate.

10. Slice the tonkatsu and plate with the cabbage. Serve with Tonkatsu sauce. If you don't have tonkatsu sauce, you can make a simple version by mixing a 1:1 ratio of ketchup and worcestershire sauce.
